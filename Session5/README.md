**Target:** 

Added colour jitter data augmentation, Change 32 filter to 16, change learning rate after every 4 epoch


**Results:**

1.	Parameters: 9702
2.	Best Train Accuracy: 98.94
3.	Best Test Accuracy: 99.42 (14th Epoch)


**Analysis:**

The model accuracy can be pushed further with more epochs as training accuracy is 98.94 and training is harder after adding dropout.
