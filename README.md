# Extensive Vision AI
In this repo there are list of projects done in extensive vision AI program under the "**The School of AI**" 


Extensive Vision AI 7 now focuses predominantly on transformers and end-to-end attention models for computer vision. 
Convolutions today act as only backbone to modern networks.In EVA7 we will tackle Transformers in ViT, DETR, and DINO, 
learning how to train object detection and segmentation without annotated data!
